  (:completions :file :help "\
Both  the  --exec  and filename parameters can take format specifiers that
are expanded by scrot when encountered. There  are  two  types  of  format
specifier.   Characters  preceded by a '%' are interpreted by strftime(2).
See man strftime for examples. These options may be used to refer  to  the
current  date and time. The second kind are internal to scrot and are pre‚Äê
fixed by '$' The following specifiers are recognised:
    $a  hostname
    $f  image path/filename (ignored when used in the filename)
    $m  thumb image path/filename (ignored when used in the filename)
    $n  image name (ignored when used in the filename)
    $s  image size (bytes) (ignored when used in the filename)
    $p  image pixel size
    $w  image width
    $h  image height
    $t  image format (ignored when used in the filename)
    $$  print a literal '$'
    \n  print a newline (ignored when used in the filename)
Example:
    scrot '%Y-%m-%d_$wx$h.png' -e 'mv $f ~/shots/'
This would create a file called  something  like  2000-10-30_2560x1024.png
and move it to your shots directory."))
