* Remove macroexpansion-time checks
  It ruins the API because you have to use eval-when-compile every time you want
  to use a function as a completion.
* Rewrite candidates using some sort of defstruct
  defgeneric?
* declare order should not be strict
  allow &option after &subcommand etc
  add &flag for this
* also apply data oriented programming
* make so as if everything was a subcommand
